A bunch of libraries and extensions made by me for modders, they are globally only maintained by me and made for my needs, but I'm totally open to pull requests, suggestions, issues etc...  
I've been working on that because many of my ideas would probably bloat Nautilus more than it is already, so I just make a bunch of additional libs.  
  
CuddleLibs work on a very simple concept called modules. Actually there is one main file containing all the main helpers, but in the future it may have many modules so the library is not bloated with things that are not useful to every users or every modders. The plan is to let the core library download these files automatically and auto-update those when possible.

## ðŸª¨ `CuddleLibs key features`
  
An non-exhaustive list of all the key features of CuddleLibs. I cannot put all of them on one page if someday there is too many features.

### Outcrops helper and utils
CuddleLibs has an incorporated module that lets developers easily add their ores to drops of certain chunks/outcrops, for example I can add a Coal drop to Limestones by doing this:

```csharp
// coalTechType may be obtained with whatever library you're using, with Nautilus you can get the
// TechType with customPrefab.Info.TechType; With SMLHelper you can use MyClass.TechType;
OutcropsUtils.EnsureOutcropDrop(coalTechType, TechType.LimestoneChunk, chance: 0.2f);

// If we want to override the spawn chance of an existing ore:
OutcropsUtils.EnsureOutcropDrop(TechType.Copper, TechType.LimestoneChunk, chance: 0.6f);  // Spawn chances are extremely high, here.

// Or if we want to add an existing ore to an other outcrop
OutcropsUtils.EnsureOutcropDrop(TechType.Gold, TechType.BreakableLead, chance: 0.025f);  // And here, spawn chances are extremely low.
```

I hope you'll use it if you make mods like that, the good point is that it does not break the compatibility with other mods as long as they use this lib too

## ðŸ“¥ `Install`
Here are some instructions on how to install CuddleLibs, even if it's like every BepInEx mod, you may need that just in case.

### Instructions
1. Download the latest (or any needed version) `.zip` file from the [**releases page**](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/CuddleLibs/releases).
2. Uncompress the downloaded file to `SubnauticaGame/BepInEx/plugins/CuddleLibs/`. It is better to check that it did not make a subfolder, so it should look like this: `SubnauticaGame/BepInEx/plugins/CuddleLibs/CuddlleLibs.dll`.
3. It's as simple as that.

### Dependencies
- [**BepInEx 5.4.21 or higher**](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (BepInEx alone is lighter, it is better for random players.)

### Dependants
- The great [**Alterra Weaponry**](https://github.com/VELD-Dev/Alterra-Weaponry/releases) ! (made by me lol)
